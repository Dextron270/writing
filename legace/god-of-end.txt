it essentially transforms matter, energy, power, anything, 
into packets of information, little cubes.
they evaporate over time
essentially a prettier version of a black hole
one that can be modulated, manipulated and controlled
but just like a black hole, it destroys everything
and returns only energy
ironicaly it is eternal
it works like an idea
creating slightly different copies of itself onto everything else
